**FreeTime is a lightweight system tray application that helps you quickly find and share your available meeting times. It checks your calendars and generates a list of free time slots that can be instantly pasted anywhere when you type a trigger phrase.**


## Demo
Anytime that you need to enter your calendar availability, just type the trigger phrase (default is "tt"). This phrase will be instantly replaced with a neat block of text showing all of your free calendar slots. 
This works in any window. 
See below:
